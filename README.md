## *nextgen-pipeline*

### Overview

*Nextgen-pipeline* is a computational pipeline for genetic variant detection in
a single sample, or in a familial cohort (typically a trio, or a quad). It is
simple, and modular in its design. Almost every step in the pipeline is done via
a *Makefile* (GNU make). These makefiles can be used on their own to accomplish
common bioinformatics operations, or they can be stung together in a shell script to compose a pipeline.
